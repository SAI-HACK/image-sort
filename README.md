## 🧠 About the Project

**IMAGE SORT** is an intelligent **AI-powered image organization system** that automatically sorts images into categorized folders using a **pre-trained deep learning model (ShuffleNetV2)** built with **PyTorch**.

Designed to handle large image collections, this project helps you:
- Save time 🕒  
- Eliminate manual sorting 🖐️  
- Keep your image libraries neat and organized 🗂️

## 🎯 Features

✅ **Automatic Classification** — Sorts images based on visual similarity.  
⚡ **High Performance** — Optimized with TorchScript for fast inference.  
🧩 **Lightweight** — Uses the efficient **ShuffleNetV2** backbone.  
🖥️ **Cross-Platform** — Works on Linux, WSL2, and Ubuntu systems.  
📁 **Organized Output** — Creates structured category folders automatically.  
🧾 **Transparent Logs** — Displays categorized results in real-time.
